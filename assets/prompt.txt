I want to build a expense tracker app API using Go and Firebase. It should support user authentication, secure storage of user data, and allow users to create, read, update, and delete expenses. Each expense should include fields such as amount, category, date, and notes. The API should be structured for scalability, maintainability, and easy integration with frontend clients (web or mobile).
